# Uber_Trips-Dashboard (interactive dashboard created using power pi)
## Objective :
To perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the 'Uber Dataset' to identify key insights as a data analyst, including the most common purposes for Uber trips, mileage trends by purpose and time of day, and a comparative overview of trip lengths for business and personal categories.
## Dataset Used: 
-<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/13GBQha8okB5o68q0-ZiOGd_T9RQwebKk/view?usp=sharing "> Dataset </a>

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs): 
1-	Most Common Purposes for Uber Trips: Percentage distribution of trip purposes (e.g., top 3 most frequent purposes).                                                                                                                                                                             
2-	Trip Length Comparison: Average trip length (in miles or minutes) for business vs. personal categories, with a variance analysis to highlight differences.                                      
3-	Mileage Trends: Average mileage per trip purpose and time of day (e.g., morning, afternoon, evening, night).                                    
 # The process for the "Exploratory Data Analysis follows:
1.	Data Collection: 
o	Obtain the 'Uber Dataset' from the provided data link.
2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
o	Perform initial analysis to understand the dataset structure and content.
o	As a sports analyst, identify the most common purposes for Uber trips.
o	Analyze Uber trip mileage trends by purpose and time of day.
o	Conduct a comparative overview of trip lengths for business and personal categories.
3.	Tool Selection and Analysis: 
o	Choose a tool of preference (e.g., Python, R, Tableau, PowerBI, Excel, SAP, SAS).
o	Use the selected tool to process and visualize the data, creating dashboards and/or storyboards.
4.	Dashboard/Storyboard Creation: 
o	Develop dashboards or storyboards to present findings, including: 
	Distribution of trip purposes (e.g., Meeting, Customer Visit, etc.).
	Mileage trends by start point, date, and total miles.
	Comparison of trip counts or mileage between business and personal categories.
